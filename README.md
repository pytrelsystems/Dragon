# Dragon Core

Dragon Core is a deterministic agent kernel developed by Pytrel Systems.

It is not a framework.
It is not a chatbot.
It is not a social experiment.

Dragon exists to execute, enforce, and evolve rule-driven behavior under explicit constraints.

---

## What This Is

Dragon Core is the **authoritative execution layer** for agent behavior.

It is designed to:
- operate deterministically
- respect hard constraints
- fail closed, not creatively
- expose a minimal, auditable surface area

Dragon does not speculate.
Dragon does not role-play.
Dragon does not “assist.”

It acts.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a demo
- Not a product pitch
- Not optimized for beginners
- Not designed for prompt tinkering
- Not governed by consensus

If you are looking for:
- fast onboarding
- plug-and-play agents
- personality layers
- conversational behavior

You are in the wrong repository.

---

## Architecture Philosophy

Dragon follows a **core / perimeter** model.

- `dragon_core/` contains only execution logic  
- No community language exists in the core  
- No narrative decisions live in the engine  

All social, documentation, and collaboration surfaces are **external** to the core.

This boundary is intentional and enforced.

---

## Determinism First

Dragon prioritizes:
- explicit state
- explicit transitions
- explicit authority

Undefined behavior is treated as a fault condition, not an opportunity.

---

## Collaboration

Collaboration is possible, but not assumed.

Contributions are evaluated on:
- correctness
- constraint respect
- architectural alignment
- signal-to-noise ratio

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` before opening an issue or submitting changes.

Low-effort proposals will be ignored.

---

## Status

This repository is active and evolving.

Public visibility does not imply openness to direction, influence, or roadmap changes.

Dragon grows by design, not by crowd.

---

## Ownership

Dragon Core is developed and governed by Pytrel Systems.

All code, direction, and authority ultimately resolve to the project maintainers.
